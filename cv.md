## About myself

My goal is to study hard and finish the JS/FE course, get full understanding of the topics covered, become a worthy specialist in the field. While I'm at it, I'd like to perfect my time-management skills for future work-related projects and studying. The priority is to meet all the deadlines for the tasks and deliver quality work during all stages.
My strong points are attention to detail, adaptability, interpersonal skills, fluent English. I strive to learn something new everyday and further develop myself.
